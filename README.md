# PrivMX Java Tools
This repository contains tools which simplify using PrivMX libraries in JVMs.

## privmx-endpoint-install-native 
This module implements a Gradle plugin that automates the process of downloading shared libraries from https://builds.simplito.com for Privmx Endpoint Java libraries.

### Options

#### - `version` (required)
The version of the native shared libraries to download.

#### - `channel` (optional)
Channel is part of the URL of the libraries. The default channel for libraries is `main` (https://builds.simplito.com/java/main).

#### - `platform` (optional)
A list of platforms (as a pair of operating system and architecture) for which to download the native shared library.
The default is the building platform.

### Usage
1. Add `mavenCentral()` repository to your `settings.gradle`:

```groovy
pluginManagement {
    repositories{
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

2. Add plugin in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    def pluginVersion = "1.0"
    id "com.simplito.privmx-endpoint-install-native" version "$pluginVersion"
}
```

3. Configure plugin in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
privmxEndpointInstallJni{
    version = $nativeLibVersion // Set the version of library to download, it should 
                                // match the privmx-endpoint-java dependency version

    // Set the channel of native libraries source
    channel = "main"

    // Set project supported platforms to download native libraries for them.
    platforms = [
            SupportedPlatforms.Darwin.arm64.platform,
            *SupportedPlatforms.Android.values().platform
    ]
}
```
